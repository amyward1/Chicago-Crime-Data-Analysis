Using Chicago crime data between the years 2007 and 2013, I first began an analysis with some basic data cleaning and exploration in Python. After loading it into Tableau I was able to further investigate patterns and trends and create visualizations around the data. The focus in this project was on trends in crimes around theft and robbery directly, before and during the 2008 recession and throughtout the recovery preiod spanning through 2012.
